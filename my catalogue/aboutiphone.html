           <p>New iPhone 12 Pro Max 512GB Blue MGDG3AA/A
5G goes Pro.
A14 Bionic rockets past every other smartphone chip. The Pro camera system takes low-light photography to the next level — with an even bigger jump on iPhone 12 Pro Max. And Ceramic Shield delivers four times better drop performance. Let’s see what this thing can do.</p>

<p>Less Bezel. More Screen
The iPhone 12 Pro Max features a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR Display compare to the 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display on the iPhone 12 Pro</p>


<p>The bigger screen is now also stronger and up to 4X more drop resistant than before. The new display is infused with nano‑ceramic crystals — which are actually harder than most metals — into the glass. Sounds simple, but it’s incredibly difficult because most ceramics aren’t transparent. By controlling the type of crystals and degree of crystallinity, we developed an exclusive formula that maximizes the toughness of the ceramic while remaining optically clear. This was the breakthrough that made Ceramic Shield ideally suited for the display. It’s a first in any smartphone, and it’s tougher than any smartphone glass.</p>

<p>Blows other phones out of the water.
Industry‑leading IP68 water resistance4 which means its water-resistant 0 meters up to 30</p>

<p>Fastest Chip in a Smartphone Ever
The A14 bionic chip is the first 5-nanometer chip in the industry, with advanced components literally atoms wide. Forty percent more transistors rev up speeds while increasing efficiency for great battery life. And a new ISP powers Dolby Vision recording — something no pro movie camera, let alone any other phone, can do. The iPhone 12 also has wireless charging.</p>

           
<p>Lidar Scanner. AR at Speed of light
The LiDAR Scanner on iPhone 12 Pro measures how long it takes light to reflect back from objects, so it can create a depth map of any space you’re in. Because it’s ultrafast and accurate, AR apps can now transform a room into a realistic rainforest or show you exactly how a new sneaker will fit.</p>

<p>The LiDAR Scanner measures absolute depth by timing how long it takes invisible light beams to travel from the transmitter to objects, then back to the receiver. LiDAR works with the depth frameworks of iOS 14 to create a tremendous amount of high-resolution data spanning the camera’s entire field of view. And the beams pulse in nanoseconds, constantly measuring the scene and refining the depth map. For AR, that’s a game-changer</p>

           
           
<p>Instant AR
LiDAR can instantly understand the surfaces in your space. So AR apps can get right to work analyzing the scene and creating custom experiences.</p>

           
           
<p>Pro Night Mode
Night mode comes to both the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, and it’s better than ever at capturing incredible low-light shots. LiDAR makes Night mode portraits possible. And the Wide camera lets in 27 percent more light, for greater detail and sharper focus day or night.</p>

LiDAR delivers up to 6x faster autofocus in low light</p>

<p>Camerus maximus.
The bigger iPhone maxes out the Pro camera system. A 47 percent larger sensor and larger pixels dramatically increase the amount of light gathered on the Wide camera. A new OIS stabilizes the sensor instead of the lens so your shots are steady — even when you’re not. And the new 65 mm Telephoto camera lets you zoom in tighter on portraits.</p>

<p>87% better low‑light photos
5x optical
zoom range
Bigger 1.7 μm pixels
New sensor-shift optical image stabilization
Portrait mode that come out at night.
Night mode portraits on the Wide camera give you vivid color, as well as beautiful bokeh that accentuates lit buildings, streetlights — any background lights.</p>

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
<p>Even with a single small light source, LiDAR and our A14 Bionic can render every pattern and texture in the foreground along with realistic color throughout the room.
Machine learning on iPhone 12 Pro is even better at separating the subject from the background. And creative controls let you adjust the background blur and light on faces.
First camera ever to record in Dolby Vision
iPhone 12 Pro jumps from 8- to 10‑bit HDR recording, capturing 700 million colors for much more lifelike video.</p>
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
<p>Then it goes one better, recording in Dolby Vision — the format used by film studios. You can even edit Dolby Vision video and use AirPlay to see every last bit of the difference on the big screen.</p>
