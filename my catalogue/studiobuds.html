    <h1>Transparency Mode</h1>
    
    
Being isolated with your music has its benefits, but sometimes you need to let the world back in. Whether you need to stay safe and hear traffic, listen to an announcement when commuting, or you just need to have a quick chat with someone, activating Transparency Mode will help you connect with others. When activated while using ANC, external-facing mics pickup and transmit outside audio to your ears.<p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
<p><h1>Extended Battery Life</h1>



The earbuds give you up to 8 hours of battery life on a full charge, and the included charging case's built-in battery can deliver an additional 16 hours of power. Simply insert the earbuds into the case and close the lid to immediately begin to recharge them. If you're in a rush, a quick 5-minute Fast Fuel recharge will give you up to 1 hour of playback.<p>
    
    
    
    
<p><h1>Environmentally Friendly</h1>




Rest easy in knowing that a purchase of the Beats Studio Buds helps the environment. The packaging is made from 92% plant-based material that is sourced from recycled fiber and/or sustainable forests.<p>
